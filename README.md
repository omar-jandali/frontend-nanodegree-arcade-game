Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

Controls for the game:

LEFT ARROW KEY: move left 1 block.
RIGHT ARROW KEY: move right 1 block.
UP ARROW KEY: move up 1 block.
DOWN ARROW KEY: move down 1 block.

Objective of the game:

The main objective of this game is to get the player from the bottom grass blocks to the river blocks without getting hit by any of the enemy bugs.
You do this by using the arrow keys to manuver around the blocks using the arrow keys.

Scoring system:

Every time you get your player to make it to the river blocks without getting hit my the enemy, you will gain a point and your score will go up.
If you get hit by any of the enemies, your current score will be reset and you will have to play again to try and get a high score.
Your high scores will be recorded so that you can see how well you are doing compared to your last score.
